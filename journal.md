when playing the game youn have to make sure you dont make the wrong move because if you do then you will lose and have to staret over and you will have to rethink your whole plane and you have to make sure when coding to not forget anything or something in your code to go wrong it could loop and get stuck or it will just not play at all so its important to cheek your code before starting your code run and its important to get into the habit of cheeking your code

brain rot is something that makes you dum making you say dumm and annoying things that what brain rot means to me  digital media has no effect on my mental health but i can't say the samething for other people  the word lore is something that has a story to it like a book or a plot line to a game and i do belive that people can  balanced  engeagment with technology without brain rot i do it all the time i play games and watch videos but that has not afftected my mental health one bit so my answer is yes you can have fun using technology whith out having to deal with brain rot

the rise in ai investment and demand is causing the tech industry to be limited by there work back then most of the work was done by hand like editing or graaphic design or making a website but know you can do that with the help of ai so if you would to ask me if ai makes things better i would give you two answers one of them would be about how yes ai is making things easy for us and it makes things better and my other answer would be how the rise of ai is making it harder for the tech industry to do there job because with the rise of ai it stops the need for them to do there job as much when they can have a ai to do it for them that is what i think about the rise of ai

the government taking away alot of tech  componies  because of there origions evean tho the owner of the app has nothing to do with stealong are data evean tho are data gets stolen anyways from other companys and apps like google or apple but they dont care because they dont come from a forin countrie if i was working in tiktok i would try my best to update security and make sure all the acusations are false in any way because when in a company like tiktok 
you have to make sure that you can help the community in any way so that way you can maintain a stable companynot to meantion the only reason tiktok is geting the ban was because of that fact it was made in china and they are worried that they will steal are data when apple has been doing that forever always with the update it is strang but still i dont think much of it but the fact its dum and beside people have alredy found a app like tiktok call redtub or something like that so all this effort will be for nothign

if i was making a machine that can analyze people praformance to determine if they have what it takes to be in the nfl and what team they would be on i would make sure it had data frome previous games and player so that way it can accurately pick players and assigned them a team and there role based on the data they have goten frome them i would also make sure it is alway up to date by making sure it have data frome every football game evan the ones not in the nfl why because it is important to find people hidden talent evean if they dont think they can do it that is the hole poit of the machine to analyze and determine in they will pass and become apart of the nfl and making sure when it find players it desplayers them and there role and how good they are at there role then making sure they are suitable forthat role they have been accurately chosen because there are some erros that are made and you will have to make sure then make sure the machine is fixed when chosen people

technology can be used to show how people talk back then like in the 2000 witch in my opion was the most normal version of the human Language because of how now a days there is a whole lot of stuff that i don't understand and i chose not to but teaching the younger generation tobe somewhat normal and not what they are now using there weird slang every time they talk instend of talking like a regular human being so the use of technology will have a grate impact on educating the younger generartion to be a bit better and to stop using so there slang so much and to make them have a normal conversation
