the rise in ai investment and demand is causing the tech industry to be limited by there work back then most of the work was done by hand like editing or graaphic design or making a website but know you can do that with the help of ai so if you would to ask me if ai makes things better i would give you two answers one of them would be about how yes ai is making things easy for us and it makes things better and my other answer would be how the rise of ai is making it harder for the tech industry to do there job because with the rise of ai it stops the need for them to do there job as much when they can have a ai to do it for them that is what i think about the rise of ai

the government taking away alot of tech  componies  because of there origions evean tho the owner of the app has nothing to do with stealong are data evean tho are data gets stolen anyways from other companys and apps like google or apple but they dont care because they dont come from a forin countrie if i was working in tiktok i would try my best to update security and make sure all the acusations are false in any way because when in a company like tiktok 
you have to make sure that you can help the community in any way so that way you can maintain a stable companynot to meantion the only reason tiktok is geting the ban was because of that fact it was made in china and they are worried that they will steal are data when apple has been doing that forever always with the update it is strang but still i dont think much of it but the fact its dum and beside people have alredy found a app like tiktok call redtub or something like that so all this effort will be for nothign

if i was making a machine that can analyze people praformance to determine if they have what it takes to be in the nfl and what team they would be on i would make sure it had data frome previous games and player so that way it can accurately pick players and assigned them a team and there role based on the data they have goten frome them i would also make sure it is alway up to date by making sure it have data frome every football game evan the ones not in the nfl why because it is important to find people hidden talent evean if they dont think they can do it that is the hole poit of the machine to analyze and determine in they will pass and become apart of the nfl and making sure when it find players it desplayers them and there role and how good they are at there role then making sure they are suitable forthat role they have been accurately chosen because there are some erros that are made and you will have to make sure then make sure the machine is fixed when chosen people

technology can be used to show how people talk back then like in the 2000 witch in my opion was the most normal version of the human Language because of how now a days there is a whole lot of stuff that i don't understand and i chose not to but teaching the younger generation tobe somewhat normal and not what they are now using there weird slang every time they talk instend of talking like a regular human being so the use of technology will have a grate impact on educating the younger generartion to be a bit better and to stop using so there slang so much and to make them have a normal conversation

with the use of Ai to help students study is a grate idea and and a bad one at the same time sure ai can help us understand a problem better by showing the steps on what to do in very good detail and if you diddent understand it you can ask it to explain the issue but the cons of using ai is that they cound very much just use Ai to simple get the answer that they need insted of doing the work and learing how to do it and when it comes time to actually do the test they will be confused because they were to lazy to look up the answer sure there willl be some people that will actually do that work step by step but most of the people who want to be done with the test  will be confused because all they know is what they got from the Ai so when it comes time to acually explaing on how to get the Answer they dont know what to put because they used Ai in my oppion student shouldn't use Ai to help them they need to learn for them self

100 men vs 1 gorilla this is a popular questions with two diffrent answers i belive if the men are well train and have a plan and the right body build then they will have a chance but a gorilla can run up to 25mph and they are very strong so if you have 3 men destract the gorilla and have the other in spacific places around the gorilla so that way when the gorilla is fully destracted they can get the jump on the gorilla because if they have five men attack one arm and 5 for the other arm then they can focus thee rest on the body so that way they can fully defeat the gorrila and some of the other men can throw rocks at the gorilla to discombobulate the gorilla

"The Chromebook Challenge" is not ethical you are destorying your chromebook which is very expensise and not to meantion the school can sue you for property dammage seeing how the chromebook's belongs to theme they could sue you for a lot of money this is why you should never follow trends you see on tick tock or youtube becasue they are most likely dumm and will get you in trouble so if you see a trend dont follow it just watch it and see how dumm it is

I think the new cell phone law is a bit flawed as student can't use their phones at lunch when the law state that student shall not be on there phones durring learing period but in lunch we don't learn anything if fact the opposit we learn nothing from lunch we just eat and hang out with friends but for the people who are anti social are left with nothing to keep them  occupied or if there is someone who is injured we can't use are phones to contact emergency services because it's against the law to have are phones out durring the learing period so if someone is to get hurt we can't use are phones to call someone but back then we could call someone now we just have to go get a staff member who could be across the school so in my oppion i do like the phone law it's just that it has many flaws that effect the safty of the sudent's they try to prottect and teach

I want to be a graphic game designer and with computer science that will help me achive my goal when designing a game you need a computer and a idea and with a computer you can get ideas from many diffrent games or pictures that you can look and with a computer it can help when coding and if you make any mistakes you can see what whent wrong and how to fix it and that is very inportant when coding and making a game and when it designing something computer helps render and figure out how to make it work and if it will work or if you have to make the changes that are needed that why i think computer science is important when trying to get into graphic game design

A good AI project would be the debate of laws basicly make an AI the looks and reviews over the current law that we have and determinds if those laws are for the betterment of the people or if they are the problem on why our comunities are in the state that there in because there are many laws that seeme good at first but are actually just the problem or public safty Concerns because AI can look over and review all the data that was presented durring and after the law was made and how well it help the comunnity or how it hurt and effected the community

i think its a great idea because some people are anti social and or have medical problems that prevent them from leaving their home or hospital this help theme earn money from from or where ever they may be or just any where that dosent have any work avaliable for them this is why i belive that ikea making it so that people can work from online in a game to earn money and with the help of AI this makes it possible and plus its less of a liablity if someone gets hurt because its just machines being piloted by people so this is less likley of a work place accident to happen so i think people should give it a chance because it could be a greate help to the people

if i was in charge i would let kids use ther phones during lunch sense this new phone law has its falws that makes many people upset secondly i would unban some games because allo tho school is meant for learing kids need to have fun and keep their minds active and allowing them to play some games third and the use of AI tool i see AI as help full at time but also a main learing problem becuse some kids will use it to an advantage just to cheat so thats why i will nott allow students to use AI because they need to learn things on their own because one way or another they will have to come with the terms that they cant just chat their way out of everything they have a hard time with and need to learn how to solve problem they come acroos on there own thats what i would do if i was in charge of running a school
